#### TimeOut Value 
  5 second. I believe 5 seconds is a reasonable time to consider other device performance. 
If you set the timeout value shorter, it may throw an exception while loading the program.
If you set the timeout value longer, it may wait too long to get a result or exception if the element you are trying to find doesn't exist
                
                

### Overall, 
it was a fun experience to deal with Selenium. It is a great tool that helps a user to understand HTML components and to get data on the page. One thing I really liked is, it provides various methods to get into the HTML elements such as id, class name, XPath, tag name, etc.

However, As the professor said Selenium is fragile. It is not a perfect tool to rely on. Because all pages are not following or providing the same HTML structure and even it has the same HTML structure, it might use a different id or tag name. If our URC project is well labeled with id it would be much easier to implement Selenium as our testing tool. It can be re-use anytime we want, and also it helps us to check and test some small but important components that we might miss.
